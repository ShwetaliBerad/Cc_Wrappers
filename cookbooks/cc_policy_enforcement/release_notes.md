Release notes - 19.3.0 :


| Policy Name             | RTC Id         | Changes       | Origin |
|:------------------------|:---------------|:--------------|:-------|
| policy_windows_defender | Feature-329827 | Handle setting of Administrative Templates - Windows Components - Windows Defender - Turn off Windows Defender. Tech-Spec: GZ.1.3.2 in CSD_Win2016 | N/A |
| policy_aix_sshd| Feature-373519 | removed supports property entry from aix_service resource | N/A |
| policy_aix_unsafe_services| Feature-373519 | removed supports property entry from aix_service resource | N/A |
| policy_linux_password_history | Feature-321539| Adding encryption_algorithm attribute with default value 'sha512' for ubuntu and RedHat in policy_linux_password_history as both have common requirement against the feature 321539.A single common deviation to show the update on remember module parameter(attribute history) for the pam files.For RHEL, even though there are two files(system-auth and password-auth) there will be single deviation to show the change.In case the value of remember is different in both the files(please note that its not the right configuration to have different values in  the pam files),the highest value of the remember parameter from both the files will be shown as the before value in the deviation message.(e.g Would update content in pamfiles FROM remember=35 TO remember=8).A single common deviation to show when pam files sets the encryption algorithm used when user changes the password.(e.g Would change encryption algorithm from md5 to sha512 in pamfiles). A single common deviation to show when pam files sets any of the following parameter : use_authtok , shadow , nullok.(e.g Would set use_authtok in pamfiles,Would set shadow in pamfiles,Would set nullok in pamfiles). Override Functionality :- If we override the deviation,1. Would update content in pamfiles FROM remember=35 TO remember=8, the before value i.e 35 will be set in the node attribute for history 2. Would change encryption algorithm from sha256 to sha512 in pamfiles, the before value i.e sha256 will      be set in the node attribute for encryption_algorithm.Note: This is not a correct configuration of the system to have different values for this arguments in different pam files.In such a case if we override the deviations,the second why run would show the deviation for the remember parameter for the pam file which had lower remember value.The second why run would show the deviation for the encryption_algorithm for the pam file which had other than sha256 value.The deviations for parameters use_authtok , shadow , nullok are non-overridable.  | IVT|
| policy_linux_log_retention| Defect-370326 | Added a new custom resource to manually enable a service for SuSE 11 as 'service' resource was not functioning as expected  | IVT |
| All AIX and Linux policies| Feature-343639 | Modified CSD and ITCS104 environment templates for AIX and Linux OS to align with techspecs | N/A |
